# TODO - Everybody Votes MVP

## ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Refactored architecture to use modular Durable Objects
- [x] Created base GameSession class with shared functionality
- [x] Created CheckboxGameSession for checkbox game
- [x] Created EverybodyVotesGameSession for Everybody Votes
- [x] Extracted GameSessionRegistry to separate file
- [x] Updated routing to use appropriate Durable Object based on game type
- [x] Created frontend EverybodyVotesGameModule with full UI
- [x] Fixed game type mapping (everybody-votes instead of votes-game)
- [x] Built and deployed with wrangler
- [x] Verified backend creates rooms successfully

## üîß In Progress / Needs Testing
- [ ] **Multi-player Puppeteer test** - Create proper test with multiple browser windows to test full game flow:
  - Host creates room
  - 2+ players join
  - Host starts game
  - All players vote (different choices)
  - All players predict
  - Verify results display correctly
  - Verify prediction accuracy is calculated

## üêõ Known Issues
1. **Start button not appearing in test** - The game module may not be initializing properly in the waiting room. Need to debug why the start button doesn't render for the host.

2. **Game module initialization** - The EverybodyVotesGameModule needs to properly receive the initial state and render the waiting phase with the start button for hosts.

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate fixes needed:
1. Debug why the start button isn't showing for the host in the waiting room
2. Ensure the game module properly initializes with the correct host ID
3. Write comprehensive multi-player Puppeteer test

### Future enhancements (after MVP is working):
1. Add multiple questions (question bank)
2. Add demographic collection (optional)
3. Add demographic breakdowns in results
4. Add cumulative scoring across multiple rounds
5. Add spectator view for live results
6. Add player-submitted questions
7. Add more visual polish and animations
8. Add sound effects
9. Add end-game summary with winners
