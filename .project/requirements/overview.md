## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- WebSocket latency: <100ms for message delivery
- Page load: <3 seconds on 3G
- Bundle size: <30KB for frontend assets
- Connection limit: 100 players per game session

### Security
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Rate limiting (10 messages/second per connection)
- Message size limits (1MB maximum)
- CORS properly configured
- Session isolation via Durable Objects

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility for core features
- High contrast mode support
- Mobile touch gestures

### Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile)
- No Internet Explorer support
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Constraints
- **Technical**: Cloudflare Workers platform limitations
- **Architecture**: Durable Objects for state management
- **Frontend**: Vanilla TypeScript only (no frameworks)
- **Development**: Port 8777 hardcoded for local development
- **Testing**: All changes must be verified with Puppeteer
- **Resource**: 100 WebSocket connections per Durable Object

## Success Metrics
- Zero-downtime deployments
- <1% error rate in production
- <100ms average WebSocket latency
- >95% player satisfaction (game completion rate)
- <30 second onboarding time for new players

## Out of Scope
- User accounts and authentication
- Persistent player profiles
- Monetization features
- Social media integration
- Native mobile apps
- Single-player modes
- AI opponents
- Voice/video chat
