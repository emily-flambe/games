# âœ… COMPLETED: Switched Primary Development Environment to Wrangler Dev

## Migration Status: COMPLETE (January 2025)

## Original Problem (RESOLVED)
We consistently encountered issues where games worked perfectly on `localhost:8777` (Node.js dev server) but failed on production (Cloudflare Workers). Debugging of the Everybody Votes game revealed critical state synchronization issues that only manifested in production, causing significant debugging overhead.

## Root Cause (ELIMINATED)
The Node.js development server (`scripts/dev-server.js`) didn't accurately replicate Cloudflare Workers' behavior, particularly:
- WebSocket connection lifecycle differences
- State synchronization timing
- Error propagation and handling
- Durable Objects behavior simulation

## Implemented Solution
Switched to `wrangler dev` as the primary development environment, which runs actual Cloudflare Workers locally and provides full parity with production.

## Implementation Completed

### Phase 1: Updated Development Scripts âœ…
- [x] Modified `package.json` to use `wrangler dev` as primary dev command
- [x] Removed Node.js server completely (no longer needed)
- [x] Updated `make dev` to use wrangler

### Phase 2: Configuration Changes âœ…
- [x] `wrangler.toml` has proper local development configuration (port 8777)
- [x] Removed dependency on `ws` package
- [x] Local Durable Objects persistence via `--persist` flag

### Phase 3: Documentation Updates âœ…
- [x] Updated README with new development workflow
- [x] Removed all references to dev-server.js
- [x] Migration documentation updated to reflect completion

### Phase 4: Developer Experience âœ…
- [x] Hot reload works with wrangler dev
- [x] Proper debugging with actual Cloudflare Workers runtime
- [x] Development workflow tested end-to-end

## Benefits
1. **Catch production issues early** - Bugs will manifest during development
2. **Reduce debugging time** - No more "works locally but not in production"
3. **True Durable Objects behavior** - Accurate state persistence and lifecycle
4. **Consistent WebSocket handling** - Same connection behavior as production
5. **Better error messages** - Cloudflare's actual error handling

## Potential Drawbacks
- Slightly slower startup time compared to Node.js
- Requires Cloudflare account even for local development
- May need internet connection for some features
- Different debugging tools/workflow

## Migration Plan
1. **Week 1**: Update scripts and test wrangler dev setup
2. **Week 2**: Run both servers in parallel, compare behavior
3. **Week 3**: Switch team to wrangler dev as default
4. **Week 4**: Deprecate Node.js server (keep as fallback)

## Success Criteria âœ…
- [x] All games work identically in wrangler dev and production
- [x] No dev-server.js or Node.js-based development environment remaining
- [x] Developer productivity improved with true production parity
- [x] Deployment confidence increased

## Code Changes Required

### package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "wrangler dev --local --persist",
    "dev:node": "node scripts/dev-server.js",
    "dev:remote": "wrangler dev"
  }
}
```

### Makefile
```makefile
dev:
	@echo "ðŸš€ Starting Wrangler development server..."
	npm run dev

dev-node:
	@echo "ðŸš€ Starting Node.js development server (legacy)..."
	npm run dev:node
```

### .gitignore
```
# Wrangler local state
.wrangler/
.dev.vars
```

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Verify all games work in wrangler dev
- [ ] Test WebSocket connections stability
- [ ] Confirm state persistence works correctly
- [ ] Validate hot reload functionality
- [ ] Check performance is acceptable

## Timeline
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated effort**: 1 week
- **Impact**: Prevents future production issues

## Acceptance Criteria âœ…
- [x] `npm run dev` starts wrangler dev server
- [x] `make dev` starts wrangler dev server
- [x] All existing games work without modification
- [x] Documentation updated with new workflow
- [x] All traces of dev-server.js removed from codebase
- [x] No regression in developer productivity
