# Frontend Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive frontend testing strategy for the Games Platform. Tests should be implemented using a modern testing framework (Jest/Vitest with Puppeteer/Playwright for E2E tests).

## Test Organization

### 1. Unit Tests
Location: `tests/unit/`

#### Game Logic
- [ ] Checkbox state management
- [ ] Win condition detection (all 9 checkboxes checked)
- [ ] Score calculation
- [ ] Timer functionality

#### Utility Functions
- [ ] Session ID generation
- [ ] URL parsing and validation
- [ ] WebSocket message formatting
- [ ] Error handling utilities

### 2. Integration Tests
Location: `tests/integration/`

#### API Communication
- [ ] **Active Rooms Endpoint**
  - Fetch active rooms list
  - Verify room metadata structure
  - Handle empty room list
  - Error handling for network failures

- [ ] **WebSocket Connection**
  - Connection establishment (ws:// and wss://)
  - Message parsing and validation
  - Reconnection logic
  - Connection cleanup on unmount

#### State Management
- [ ] Player state synchronization
- [ ] Game state updates
- [ ] Room state transitions
- [ ] Spectator state handling

### 3. End-to-End Tests
Location: `tests/e2e/`

#### Room Lifecycle
- [ ] **Room Creation Flow**
  - Navigate to game portal
  - Select checkbox game
  - Verify room code generation
  - Confirm room appears in active rooms list
  - Validate room metadata

- [ ] **Room Joining Flow**
  - Enter valid room code
  - Join existing room
  - Verify player appears in room
  - Handle invalid room codes
  - Handle full rooms

- [ ] **Room Cleanup**
  - Verify room removal after game end
  - Confirm cleanup after all players leave
  - Test timeout-based cleanup

#### Multiplayer Scenarios
- [ ] **Host Management**
  - First player becomes host (ðŸ‘‘ indicator)
  - Host can start game
  - Host sees start button
  - Host transfer on disconnect

- [ ] **Multi-Player Interaction**
  - 2-player game flow
  - 4-player game flow
  - Maximum player limit enforcement
  - Player disconnection handling
  - Simultaneous actions

#### Game Flow
- [ ] **Game Start**
  - Only host can start
  - All players receive game_started event
  - UI transitions to game view
  - Spectators see game in progress

- [ ] **Gameplay**
  - Checkbox clicking functionality
  - State synchronization across players
  - Real-time updates
  - Action validation

- [ ] **Win Conditions**
  - All checkboxes checked detection
  - Winner announcement
  - End game screen display
  - Points/score display

- [ ] **Post-Game**
  - Play again functionality
  - Return to lobby
  - Create new room
  - Maintain session after game end

#### Spectator Experience
- [ ] **Joining In-Progress Games**
  - Join after game started
  - See spectator indicator
  - View game state without interaction
  - "(YOU)" marker for current spectator

- [ ] **Spectator UI**
  - Spectator count display
  - Spectator list
  - Clear status indicators
  - No game controls

#### UI Components
- [ ] **Game Portal**
  - Game card selection
  - Navigation
  - Active rooms display
  - Room filtering/sorting

- [ ] **Room UI**
  - Player list display
  - Room code visibility
  - Start button (host only)
  - Game status indicators

- [ ] **Game Board**
  - Checkbox grid rendering
  - Click interactions
  - Visual feedback
  - State indicators

- [ ] **End Game Screen**
  - Winner display
  - Final scores
  - Action buttons
  - Animation/transitions

### 4. Performance Tests
Location: `tests/performance/`

- [ ] **Load Testing**
  - Multiple concurrent rooms
  - Many players per room
  - Rapid state changes
  - WebSocket message throughput

- [ ] **UI Performance**
  - Render performance with many elements
  - Animation smoothness
  - Memory leak detection
  - Bundle size monitoring

### 5. Accessibility Tests
Location: `tests/a11y/`

- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Color contrast validation
- [ ] Focus management
- [ ] ARIA labels and roles

### 6. Cross-Browser Tests
Location: `tests/compatibility/`

- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

## Test Environment Configuration

### Local Development
```javascript
const TEST_CONFIG = {
  BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:8777',
  WS_URL: 'ws://localhost:8777',
  API_BASE: 'http://localhost:8777/api',
  TIMEOUT: 10000,
  HEADLESS: true
};
```

### Production Testing
```javascript
const PROD_CONFIG = {
  BASE_URL: 'https://games.emilycogsdill.com',
  WS_URL: 'wss://games.emilycogsdill.com',
  API_BASE: 'https://games.emilycogsdill.com/api',
  TIMEOUT: 15000,
  HEADLESS: true
};
```

## Test Data Management

### Mock Data
- Predefined room codes for testing
- Sample player names
- Test game states
- Error scenarios

### Test Utilities
```javascript
// Helper functions needed
- createTestRoom()
- joinTestRoom(roomCode)
- waitForGameState(state)
- simulatePlayerAction(action)
- cleanupTestRoom()
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Frontend Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Unit tests
      - Integration tests
      - E2E tests (headless)
      - Performance tests
      - Accessibility tests
```

### Test Execution Strategy
1. **Pre-commit**: Unit tests only (fast feedback)
2. **Pull Request**: Unit + Integration tests
3. **Main branch**: Full test suite
4. **Nightly**: Extended E2E + Cross-browser tests

## Success Metrics
- Unit test coverage: >80%
- Integration test coverage: >70%
- E2E critical path coverage: 100%
- Test execution time: <5 minutes for PR checks
- Zero flaky tests in CI

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
- [ ] Install test framework (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] Configure Puppeteer/Playwright
- [ ] Setup test structure
- [ ] Create test utilities

### Phase 2: Critical Path (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Implement room lifecycle tests
- [ ] Implement game flow tests
- [ ] Implement multiplayer tests

### Phase 3: Coverage (Week 4)
- [ ] Add spectator tests
- [ ] Add error handling tests
- [ ] Add performance tests

### Phase 4: CI/CD (Week 5)
- [ ] Setup GitHub Actions
- [ ] Configure test reporting
- [ ] Add coverage badges
- [ ] Documentation

## Notes

### Current Test Coverage Gaps
Based on the existing test scripts, the following areas need additional coverage:
- Error recovery scenarios
- Network interruption handling
- Session persistence
- Mobile-specific interactions
- Accessibility compliance
- Security testing (XSS, injection)

### Deprecated Test Scripts
The individual test scripts in `tests/` directory will be replaced by this organized test suite. They serve as reference for test scenarios but should not be maintained going forward.
