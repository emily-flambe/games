# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Shared Checkbox Game is an extremely simple multiplayer web game designed to demonstrate real-time shared connections between multiple players. Players can join a shared game session and interact with a grid of checkboxes, with all actions visible to other connected players in real-time. This serves as a "hello world" level proof-of-concept for multiplayer functionality.
