## Introduction

The Drawing Competition game is a multiplayer interactive game where players compete by creating drawings based on prompts and then vote on the best submissions. The game supports different user roles (host, player, spectator) and follows a structured flow from lobby setup through drawing, voting, and results phases. The system must provide real-time synchronization, anonymous voting, and comprehensive result displays.

### Requirement 3
