# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Everybody Votes game is a multiplayer voting and prediction game where players answer two-choice questions, predict which answer will be more popular, and then see results broken down by demographics. The game emphasizes social dynamics and demographic analysis, allowing players to see how different groups vote and test their ability to predict crowd behavior.
